# Local Development Environment

This repo contains a basic setup for a PHPstorm D8/D9/D10 setup using Acquia BLT. Its intended to be used for development of multiple modules at once.

Adding a local module repository
```
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "upstreams/event",
        "symlink": "true"
    },
```
